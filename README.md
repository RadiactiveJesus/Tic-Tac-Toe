#Tic Tac Toe.
==============================
In this project We've created the Tic Tac Toe game to play on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. This program is built using the Ruby Programming language.
---
================================
## How To Play:
	[1, 2, 3]
	[4, 5, 6]
	[7, 8, 9]
Navigate to the bin folder and open the Ruby file on the command line using $ruby executable.rb 
Then you can start taking turns
Each number corresponds to one position on the Board. You can type the number of the position to play your turn there. We switch  turns after each player plays and the game ends if a player wins or the board is full, if it is then the game is a tie. Player1 is represented by the letter 'X' and Player2 by the letter 'O'.

If Player1 plays in postion 5 that means that an 'X' will be placed in row 2 and column 2. the same thing will occur with Player2, but will display an 'O' instead of an 'X'
